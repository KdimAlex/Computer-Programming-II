0. Assuming you use binary search, what is the largest number of pages you have
   to look at in order to look up a word in an alphabetical dictionary with
   1,000 pages?  With 1,000,000 pages?  With 1,000,000,000 pages?

	10, 20, 30





1. How many numbers can YOUR computer (the one you use to do your homework) add
   up in one millisecond (1/1000 second)?  If you don't remember the exact speed
   of your computer, take a guess.

	It's at least a billion per second.

        So at least a million.




2. Using ui.getInfo(prompt) and ui.sendMessage(message), write code that gets a name
   from the user and sends a message "Hello [name]" (say hello to the name) or
   "Blank names are not allowed" if the user gives you a blank name or does nothing
   if the user clicks CANCEL.

	String name = ui.getInfo("Enter name");
        if (name != null) {
          if (name.length() == 0 || name.equals(""))
             ui.sendMessage("Blank names not allowed.");
          else
             ui.sendMessage("Hello " + name);
        }

	name = ui.getInfo("Enter name");
        if (name == null)
           break;
        if (name.length() == 0 || name.equals("")) {
             ui.sendMessage("Blank names not allowed.");
             break;
        }
        ui.sendMessage("Hello " + name);
        break;





3. If a class implements an interface, does it need to have a public method with
   the same name and parameters for EVERY method in the interface?  Can the
   class have methods OTHER than those in the interface it implements?  (Hint:
   ArrayBasedPD.)

	yes
        yes




4. If name1="Victor and name2="Vincent", then name1.compareTo(name2) is -11
   because 'c' comes 11 letters before 'n'.  What is it if name1="Jean" and
   name2="Jane"?

	4




You are testing your homework, but you have not implemented SortedPD find yet, so
the directory will not yet be in alphabetical order.  You look at the contents of
theDirectory and size using the debugger.  What you see is below.  Show the result
of a single operation described in 5, 6, 7, or 8.  Each question is INDEPENDENT and
refers to the ORIGINAL theDirectory and size below.  Each time pretend that is the
ONLY OPERATION you do.

theDirectory:  Jay 1, Bob 8, Ian 2, Ann 3, Eve 6, null, null
size:  5

5. Result of ArrayBasedPD.remove(1).  (Remember, [1] is Bob!!)

theDirectory:  Jay 1, Eve 6, Ian 2, Ann 3, Eve 6, null, null



size: 4


6. Result of SortedPD.remove(1).

theDirectory:  Jay 1, Ian 2, Ann 3, Eve 6, Eve 6, null, null

               Jay 1, Ian 2, Ann 3, Eve 6, null, null, null

size: 4


7. Result of ArrayBasedPD.add(1, new DirectoryEntry("Zoe", 7)).
   (Only change two locations!)

theDirectory:  Jay 1, Zoe 7, Ian 2, Ann 3, Eve 6, Bob 8, null



size: 6


8. Result of SortedPD.add(1, new DirectoryEntry("Zoe", 7)).

theDirectory:  Jay 1, Zoe 7, Bob 8, Ian 2, Ann 3, Eve 6, null



size: 6


9. Results of ArrayBasedPD.found(2, "Hal") and SortedPD.found(2, "Hal").
   True or false?  Two answers.

	true
        false
