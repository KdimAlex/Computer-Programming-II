0. How many cycles per second in a GHz (giga Hertz)?

	1000000000
        a billion

	10 to the 9th power



1. Which power of 2 is closest to a million?  What is the nearest integer to
   log 1000000?
      2

	2 to the 20
        20




2. What is the minimum time to the nearest second that a computer with 16 GB RAM
   and a quad (4) core 2 GHz processor can locate all bytes in its RAM which are
   set to 'V'?

	4 (cores) times 2 billion per second = 8 billion per second
        so for 16 billion
        2 seconds




3. Give at least two reasons why it is a harder task for Google to find the best
   ten web pages with Victor Milenkovic on them (compared to #2).

	more web pages than bytes (57 billion vs 16 billion)

        speed of light, can't get a web page in a nanosecond!

        web pages are bigger than one byte:  more like a kilobyte

        Looking for a name that's more than 10 bytes long. More characters than 'V'.

        orders pages by relevance (search rank)

        


4. If a single weighing can determine that a pile of coins contains one real coin,
   how many weighings does it take to locate the one real coin in a pile of 1000?

	10
        500, 250, 125, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

        could be 11
        maaaybe could be 9



5. Same question, pile of n?

	log to the base 2 of n

        log n
           2

6. Why doesn't Laptop.getPower compile and what are two ways to fix it?

	ramSize and speed are private in Computer

        1. make it protected in Computer

        2. call the public accessor method

	(Solution shown above.)




After you fix Laptop.getPower, what will the following code (#7-#9) do?
Answer compiler error, runtime exception, or what it prints out.

7. 	Computer c = new Laptop(8, 2.5, 7.5);
	System.out.println(c.getWeight());

	
        Compiler error.  getWeight is not a method of Computer
        so it can't be called for a Computer variable.


8. 	Computer c = new Laptop(8, 2.5, 7.5);
	System.out.println(c.getPower());

	prints out 8 * 2.5 / 2
        
        10


9. 	Computer c = new Computer(16, 3.0);
	Laptop l = (Laptop) c;
	System.out.println(l.getPower());


        Runtime error.
